All credit goes [Brian Lovin](https://twitter.com/brian_lovin) whose plugin, [iOS Export Settings](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/747172434405306948/iOS-Export-Settings), gave me the initial idea and also allowed me to fork his repo on GitHub and tweak a few values to publish this plugin.

Feel free to ping me on Twitter [@justinmfarrugia](https://twitter.com/justinmfarrugia) if you have any questions or ideas around how I can extend this plugin.
